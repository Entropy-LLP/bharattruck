-- migration 0025: POD evidence hardening — camera-only capture, on-device hash,
-- server-authoritative time, geofence-gated OTP, structured discrepancy, and the
-- delivery_asserted lifecycle branch. (feat/pod-rebuild.)
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS: the receiver-OTP POD that ships today (migration 0010) proves a
-- code reached the consignee's inbox. That is one control. INDIA_FREIGHT_COMPLIANCE.md
-- §5.5 is blunt that a single control loses a contested dispute — a photo alone is
-- "trivially defeated", a geotag alone "collapses once contested". The strength comes
-- from the COMBINATION: an on-device hash nobody can recompute, a server clock the
-- driver cannot reset, a live GPS trail that has to stay internally consistent for
-- hours, and a server-held quantity the driver cannot edit. These tables are where
-- those controls become durable. The OTP path is NOT replaced; it is the confirmed
-- tier of a two-tier proof (§5, D-13/D-14, ARCHITECTURE_UNIFIED_IDENTITY.md §6.3).
--
-- STRICTLY ADDITIVE + IDEMPOTENT. Runs against the live DB (677 bookings) with no
-- backfill and no destructive change: add-column-if-not-exists, create-table-if-not-
-- exists, and the enum value behind `add value if not exists`. Every existing row is
-- untouched and every existing query keeps its shape. Do NOT depend on 0023/0024/0025
-- having been APPLIED — this file references only its own new objects plus columns
-- that predate it (bookings, drivers, pod_evidence within this file).
--
-- APPLY IS GATED on live-Supabase access and is done BY HAND (BLOCKERS.md B-0 precedent,
-- CLAUDE.md migration procedure). The service code tolerates a database where this has
-- not landed yet: READS answer "no evidence", the geofence gate stays OFF, and the
-- existing email-OTP POD behaves EXACTLY as it does today. WRITES on the new endpoints
-- fail loud with a 503 rather than silently pretending to store legal evidence — the
-- same missing-relation contract fleet.ts and documents/repository.ts already use.
--
-- NO PostGIS (frozen contract §3.1 D-007): lat/lng are plain decimals; every distance
-- is haversine in app code. This schema stays portable.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- 1. Lifecycle: the delivery_asserted branch.
--
-- WHY A NEW STATE, not a flag: when the receiver CANNOT confirm — no smartphone, a
-- night drop, a warehouse hand-off to a loader who will not touch an OTP — the driver
-- still delivered, but there is no consignee-held secret to prove it. Folding that into
-- 'completed' would make a weaker proof silently indistinguishable from an OTP-confirmed
-- one (ARCHITECTURE_UNIFIED_IDENTITY.md §6.3). So the trip moves in_transit →
-- delivery_asserted (evidence captured, receiver absent), and ops — not the driver —
-- closes it to 'completed'. The strength tier is carried on pod_state below, so a trip
-- that ops closes from delivery_asserted is NEVER retroactively upgraded to 'confirmed'.
--
-- The value is ADDED but never USED in this migration (no default, no CHECK references
-- it): Postgres forbids using a freshly-added enum label in the same transaction that
-- adds it, and migration 0011 established this exact pattern (add 'paid', create tables).
alter type booking_status add value if not exists 'delivery_asserted';

-- 2. pod_evidence — the capture record. One row per photo (a delivery may need
--    several: the goods, the stamped LR, a damaged carton).
--
-- 🔴 THE INTEGRITY STORY THIS TABLE IS BUILT AROUND (§5.2, §5.4):
--   * sha256_original is hashed ON THE DEVICE before upload and stored VERBATIM. The
--     server never recomputes it from bytes it re-encoded — server-side-only hashing
--     would only prove integrity from the server onward, exactly the segment nobody
--     disputes. sha256_received is filled ONLY when the WORM object store is wired and
--     asserts equality against the original; until then it is NULL (storage is inert).
--   * The original bytes are NEVER re-encoded (IT Act s.7(b)). This service records
--     metadata only and hands the pixels straight to object storage; re-compressing a
--     POD photo on upload is the single most common way logistics apps destroy their
--     own evidence, so the byte path deliberately never passes through app code.
--   * captured_at_server is authoritative; captured_at_device is a CLAIM; the gap is
--     stored as clock_skew_seconds because a large skew is itself a fraud signal (§5.4).
--   * capture_method is CHECK-constrained to camera-only. Gallery import destroys
--     provenance and is the most common fraud vector (§5.4 rule 1), so a gallery-sourced
--     row cannot exist at the storage layer, not merely at the API. The column exists so
--     the control is auditable, and the CHECK is what makes it enforceable.
--   * mock_location_detected + gps_source + gps_accuracy_m are recorded, not blocked:
--     an honest phone with developer options on can false-positive, so a mock fix
--     DOWNGRADES the proof (surfaced on pod_state) rather than rejecting a real delivery.

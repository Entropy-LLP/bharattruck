// km to run. Every class was underwater, worst at HCV, where the platform quoted
// 22 against a 36.7 cost and the carrier ate ~15/km. That is what put negative
// margins on the fleet P&L dashboards.
//
// Two hardcoded tables cannot stay in sync, and the failure is silent and
// one-directional: raise DIESEL_PRICE_INR and the cost side moves while the rate
// side does not, so the same bug quietly comes back and deepens with every fuel
// move. Deriving the rate from the cost makes "priced below cost" structurally
// unreachable for any positive margin multiple.

// ADVISORY vs BINDING — what the number MEANS (D-11).
//
// On an auction the platform does not have a price. The shipper is shown a
// benchmark; the charge is the winning carrier's bid. Until now the response
// said nothing about which of those it was, so the distinction lived only in the
// shipper form's local `bookingType` state — the server asserted a price and the
// client decided, on its own, whether to believe it. Nothing in the persisted
// price_quotes row recorded the difference, so a row read back later could not
// answer "was this quote the charge, or a reference?".
//
// Which is why the classification is only half the fix. quote_kind is worth
// nothing unless the caller tells the server which booking it is quoting: an
// auction stored as `binding` is not a missing label, it is a WRONG one, and a
// wrong one written down. The shipper booking form therefore sends its
// booking_type on every quote, and the round-trip is pinned in test/.
//
// This is not only a product decision. Under Indian GST, a platform that SETS
// the freight price drifts toward being a "goods transport agency" — a tax and
// cargo-liability characterisation, not a labelling exercise. Price DISCOVERY
// (a benchmark derived from an operating-cost model) is safe; price SETTING is
// the exposure. See INDIA_FREIGHT_COMPLIANCE.md §1.3 red line 3, which lists
// "the platform sets the freight price" as one of three tells that pull toward
// GTA characterisation, and §9.4, which names this service. Founder decision
// Q20 ("the platform never has its own price") and the legal constraint point
// the same way, which is why they must be kept pointing the same way.
//
// So: do NOT "simplify" this by dropping quote_kind and letting every quote be
// a price. The label is the substance — it is what makes the auction number a
// reference rather than a rate the platform charges.

// classifier was right, the real route was right, and the shipper's booking form

// default), production is ~94% auctions, so the effect was to write
// `breakdown_json.quote_kind = 'binding'` — a positive, machine-readable assertion
// that the platform charged that freight — onto the overwhelming majority of
// quotes, on precisely the booking type where INDIA_FREIGHT_COMPLIANCE.md §1.3 red

// EmailSender — thin swappable interface. Prod uses SmtpEmailSender; local dev
// uses ConsoleEmailSender; tests inject a mock. Nothing else in the POD flow
// knows which transport is active.
//
// SMTP (nodemailer) is the platform-wide transactional channel — bt-auth-service
// already sends every login OTP / verification / magic link through it, and this
// service reuses the SAME `SMTP_*` env contract so there is one mail config to
// operate rather than two. An earlier revision of this file used Resend and
// described it as a settled decision; it was not — `docs/CTO_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`
// T-CTO-1 ("pick the email provider") is still open, and no Resend key was ever
// provisioned, so POD mail silently degraded to console logging in production.

/**
 * Shared notification primitives: the SMTP transport, the event catalogue, and the
 * outbox enqueue helper.
 *
 * This module owns the two halves of the platform's email story:
 *
 *   1. SYNCHRONOUS sends (`EmailSender`) — a code a human is actively waiting for:
 *      login OTP, magic link, password reset, POD receiver OTP. These must not go
 *      through a polled queue; the poll interval would be added to every login.
 *      bt-auth-service and bt-cargo-ledger send inline through this interface.
 *
 *   2. ASYNCHRONOUS events (`enqueueNotification`) — everything else: auctions,
 *      trip lifecycle, payments, fleet invites. These become a row in
 *      notification_outbox (migration 021) and are drained by bt-booking-service's
 *      dispatcher, with retries and a delivery audit trail. A producer NEVER blocks
 *      on SMTP and never fails a business operation because a mail server was slow.
 *
 * Both halves share one transport and one `SMTP_*` env contract so there is a single
 * mail config to operate. Before this module the transport was copy-pasted into
 * bt-auth-service (three inline functions, rebuilding the connection per send) and
 * bt-cargo-ledger — exactly the duplication the README of this package exists to stop.

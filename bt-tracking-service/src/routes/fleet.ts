//
// WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE bt-fleet-service's GET /fleet/live: that endpoint is
// DRIVER-centric — it starts from the fleet's driver set, so a truck with nobody assigned
// to it does not appear on the map at all. For an owner's dashboard that is backwards. The
// trucks earning nothing in the yard are precisely the ones costing money, and a board that
// silently omits them reads as "all good" while half the fleet is idle.
//
// So this starts from `vehicles`. Every asset the owner has is a row, always. A missing
// driver, trip, or GPS fix becomes an explicit STATUS and REASON on that truck rather than
// a dropped row — the owner should always be able to see the difference between "this truck
// is fine and parked" and "this truck should be moving and we have lost it".
//
// COST: one Redis MGET and a bounded set of Postgres queries per poll, independent of fleet
// size. Deliberately NO Google call — route and ETA stay lazy, one selected truck at a time,
// exactly as bt-fleet-service's own cost note requires (§3.1 §6.4).

// createBooking — the price quote-lock saga.
// Only shippers can create bookings. The shipper sends a quote_id (the
// price-lock handle), never a raw price. We read the locked quote from
// pricing (own-your-data: booking never touches the price_quotes table),
// validate it, set bookings.quoted_price SERVER-SIDE from the lock, insert,
// then atomically consume the quote so it can never be replayed.
//
// Every validation failure is a 4xx envelope, never a 500: a missing quote is
// NOT_FOUND, someone else's quote is FORBIDDEN, an expired quote is
// VALIDATION_ERROR, an already-consumed quote is INVALID_TRANSITION, and a
// pricing outage is UPSTREAM_ERROR (502) — all raised as BookingError.
//
// The true replay/expiry guard is the DB conditional UPDATE inside pricing's
// consumeQuote (WHERE consumed_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()). The pre-checks
// below keep the happy path clean and give precise errors; step 5 is the
// concurrency-safe guard against a double-submit of one quote_id.
//
// Step 3 is the WHOLE POINT of the lock: the booking's route + cargo MUST match
// the coords/weight/load the quote was priced from, or the price SHOWN would not
// be the price for the trip actually booked (a shipper could quote a 1 km / 1 kg
// trip then book a 1400 km / 20 t trip on the same lock). distance_km is NOT
// checked directly — it is DERIVED from the coords server-side at quote time, so
// binding the coords binds the priced distance.
// -----------------------------------------------------------

// quote and the booking; the quote's coords come back rounded to the column's
// 6 dp, well inside this epsilon.

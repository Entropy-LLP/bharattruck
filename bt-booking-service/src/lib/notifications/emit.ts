// ============================================================
// src/lib/notifications/emit.ts
//
// Responsibility: the domain-facing notification API. One function per business
// event; each resolves the audience, snapshots the payload, and queues an outbox
// row. This replaces the `jobs.ts` stubs (notifyDriver / notifyShipper /
// notifyNewQuote), which had been TODO no-ops since the service was written —
// every call site was already there, none of them did anything.
//
// CONTRACT FOR EVERY FUNCTION HERE: never throw, never block the caller's result.
// Awarding an auction is the real work; telling people about it is a consequence.
// A mail server being down must not fail an award, so each function is wrapped in
// its own try/catch and failures are logged, not propagated.
//
// DEDUPE KEYS include the recipient role whenever one event mails more than one
// person (`trip_completed:<id>:shipper` vs `:carrier`). The unique index in
// migration 021 is on dedupe_key alone, so a key that omits the role would let the
// first insert win and silently swallow the second person's email.

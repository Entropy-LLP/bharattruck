// The wire contract for GET /me/feed (D-38, docs/ARCHITECTURE_UNIFIED_IDENTITY.md
// §3.2 / §10.2): ONE ranked, time-ordered list of TYPED items, each carrying the
// PERSONA TAG it belongs to.
//
// The tag is the whole point. The unified app renders one home screen; the object
// supplies the context, not a mode switch — so a row tagged 'shipper' renders in
// the shipper idiom and a row tagged 'driver' in the driver idiom, interleaved, on
// the same surface. For a single-capability human the list contains one kind of
// thing and is indistinguishable from today's single-purpose home (§3.2, the
// property that makes it safe to ship).

 * idiom to render it in. NOT the caller's global persona: one human's feed can
 * carry 'shipper' and 'carrier' and 'fleet' rows at once (the distributor case).
 *
 * Mirrors BookingRelation from @bharattruck/shared/personas, plus 'fleet' for the
 * operate-side events that are not about one booking's carriage relation (a driver
 * accepting an invite, a truck needing assignment). 'observer' has no place here —
 * the feed only ever contains rows the caller is a party to.

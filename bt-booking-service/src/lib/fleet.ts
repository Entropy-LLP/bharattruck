// Responsibility: everything bt-booking-service needs to know about the
// fleet-owner persona — who is bidding, whether a driver is fleet-controlled,
// and whether an awarded fleet booking has a truck+driver bound to it yet.
// The fleet's own CRUD (roster, vehicles, assignment) lives in bt-fleet-service;
// this file only answers the questions the booking flow has to ask.
//
// DESIGN RULE for this whole slice: a booking or driver with NO fleet
// involvement must take the code path it took before the persona existed. The
// fleet tables are consulted only to answer "is this actor fleet-controlled?",
// and a database where migrations 0015/0016 have not landed yet answers "no"
// rather than failing the request — the migrations are additive and may deploy
// after this code does.
//
// IDENTITY: fleet_owners.user_id references users.id (the JWT `userId`), while
// fleet_drivers.driver_id references drivers.id — a DIFFERENT row from users.id.

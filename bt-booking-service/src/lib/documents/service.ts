// Responsibility: who may issue which document on a booking, what the platform
// fills in itself, and what it will accept from a client.
//
// 🔴 THE CONTROL THIS FILE EXISTS FOR (red line 1, §1.3): the ISSUER of an LR is
// derived from the BOOKING and the AUTHENTICATED ACTOR — never from the request
// body. A caller cannot name the party a document is issued by, and in particular
// cannot make BharatTruck the named issuer, because there is no code path that
// reads an issuer identity off the wire. The platform is never a party; it holds
// the pen for the carrier, and the carrier's own series numbers the document.
//
// The second control is §11.4: the invoice number, the invoice value and the
// e-way bill number printed on an LR are READ FROM OUR OWN ROWS, not accepted
// from the caller. On paper a booking clerk retypes them and they drift — one
// specimen pair is out by ₹63,776 on a hand-keyed invoice value, and consignment
// value drives the e-way bill threshold, so that is not a clerical matter.
// Generating both documents is what removes the entire class of error, and
// removing it means refusing to take the number from a human.

// -----------------------------------------------------------
// WHEN a document may be issued — 🔴 the gate, not a formality.
//
// Every issuance BURNS A SERIAL out of a gapless, per-owner, per-financial-year
// series (§3.3). Migration 0024 has no void and no cancel: once a number is on a
// row it is spent, and Rule 46(b) wants the series consecutive. So minting a
// consignment note or a tax invoice against a trip that never ran does not just
// produce a junk row — it puts a permanent hole in a legally sequenced series,
// and a tax invoice in particular is a statutory document with GST consequences
// attached to a supply that did not happen.
//
// The precedent is setReceiverEmail (lib/service.ts): a status allowlist and a
// 409 INVALID_TRANSITION, terminal bookings frozen. Same shape here.
//
// 🔴 THE TWO DOCUMENTS DO NOT UNLOCK AT THE SAME MOMENT, and treating them as one
// gate is how this gets written wrong:
//
//   LORRY RECEIPT — 'accepted' and 'in_transit' ONLY. It is a RECEIPT FOR GOODS
//   HANDED OVER: issuing one transfers the lien and makes the carrier responsible
//   for the goods until safe delivery (CBIC Flyer 38, §3.1). It cannot open before
//   a carrier exists to take that custody — which is why 'pending'/'negotiating'
//   are out, and why the carrier-assigned check below is the identity half of the
//   same rule. It closes when the carriage does: once POD has proved delivery, the
//   custody the LR evidences has already ended, so a serial minted then is a
//   backdated document. Nullable vehicle_number in 0024 is deliberate — an LR
//   raised at 'accepted', before the truck is finally allotted, is normal.
//
//   TAX INVOICE — from 'pending' through 'completed'. It is the SHIPPER's document
//   for the goods they sold, not a freight bill, and it is raised against the
//   GOODS rather than against the carriage: EWB-01 Part A field A.4 takes ITS
//   number (§2), so the shipper needs it BEFORE a carrier has been found at all.
//   It stays open through 'completed' because a TO_BE_BILLED consignment (§5.8) is
//   invoiced after delivery.
//
// Both stop dead at the terminal states, which is the defect this closes: 'paid'
// (the money is settled — a tax invoice raised now is a demand for payment already
// made) and 'cancelled' (no goods moved, so there is nothing to receipt and no
// supply to invoice). TERMINAL_BOOKING_STATUSES is derived from VALID_TRANSITIONS
// so this cannot drift away from the lifecycle.

 * Answered off the invoice we just wrote, because its consignment_value_inr is
 * the DB-generated Rule 138 Explanation 2 figure — the same number an officer
 * would compute. Thresholding on taxable_value_inr instead is the §4.1 bug:
 * ₹48,000 + 5% = ₹50,400 needs a bill and ₹48,000 says it does not, and the
 * difference is a s.129 detention.
 *
 * The two ends of the movement are read from what the invoice already carries —
 * explicit state codes first, then the first two digits of the GSTINs, which ARE
 * the state code. Shipped-to beats billed-to because the goods go to the
 * shipped-to address (§11.3 / §5.4); head-office billing with a warehouse
 * delivery 400km away is ordinary. Where neither end can be established,
 * ewayBillRequirement declines to answer rather than guessing 'not required'.

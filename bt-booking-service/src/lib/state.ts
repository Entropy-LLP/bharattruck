//
// Derived from VALID_TRANSITIONS rather than written out again, because a second
// hand-maintained list of "frozen" statuses is a list that goes stale. A status
// with no legal next state is terminal by definition: the booking will never move
// again, so anything that hangs a new artefact off it is rewriting history rather
// than recording it.
//
// This exists so the freight-document issuance gates (lib/documents/service.ts)
// cannot drift from the lifecycle. A tax invoice or a consignment note minted
// against a cancelled booking burns a serial out of a GAPLESS, legally sequenced
// series for a trip that never ran, and migration 0024 has no void or cancel
// concept that could take it back.

// assertFleetAssignmentReady
// Extra guard on accepted → in_transit for FLEET-won bookings only.
//
// A fleet may bid with no free truck (founder Q10), so the award leaves
// bookings.driver_id NULL and binds nothing physical. The owner then pairs a
// driver and a truck in bt-fleet-service, which writes the vehicle_assignments
// row. Until that row exists the trip has no truck of record, so its distance,
// fuel and per-asset P&L would be unattributable — hence the trip cannot start.
//
// Pure and synchronous like the transition guards above: the caller does the
// lookup and only for a booking that actually carries fleet_owner_id, so a solo
// booking (fleet_owner_id NULL) never reaches this function at all.

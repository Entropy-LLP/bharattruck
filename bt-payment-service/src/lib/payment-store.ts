// PaymentStore — durable money records (payments + payouts, migration
// 011). Injected as a dependency so it is faked in tests. Unlike the
// best-effort breadcrumb/POD writes, money writes are HARD: a failure
// must surface (never silently "succeed"), so settle() lets store
// errors propagate.
//
// Payout writes are READ-THEN-INSERT-OR-UPDATE, never ON CONFLICT.
// PostgREST's `on_conflict=` has to name a real unique constraint, so an
// upsert inferring on (booking_id, payee_type) raises 42P10 against any
// schema where migration 0023 has not been applied yet — and migrations in
// this project are applied BY HAND while .github/workflows/deploy.yml
// auto-deploys this service on any bt-payment-service/** change. Inferring
// would therefore make EVERY settlement 500 between the merge and the
// migration. Deciding insert-vs-update from the rows we already have to read
// (settle() reconciles the payee set anyway) removes that coupling outright:
// the same code runs unchanged on the pre-0023 and post-0023 schema.
//
// The uniqueness constraint is still the real guard, it is just no longer the
// thing the QUERY depends on: two racing settles both read "no row" and both
// INSERT, and the constraint turns the loser into a 23505 rather than a second
// payout row. That surfaces as a 500 with no payments row written, so the
// retry re-reads and takes the UPDATE branch. Losing the race is a retry;
// losing the constraint would be a double payout.

//
// So the caller passes which addressing the live table supports, and it is not

// exists. Deriving it from the data avoids a schema probe and cannot drift.

// (PGRST204 / 42703), so sending them unconditionally would break the only
// settlement path that currently exists. `payouts.payee_type` defaults to
// 'driver' once 0016 lands, so omitting it is correct on both schemas.
//
// A FLEET payout necessarily runs on a post-0016 database — a fleet booking
// cannot exist without that migration — so it sends both columns.
//
// The D-7 split's DRIVER row rides the same branch and stays correct there:

// exactly the value `payouts_one_per_payee` and every later read needs it to be
// — including the reconciliation read that decides insert vs update vs delete.

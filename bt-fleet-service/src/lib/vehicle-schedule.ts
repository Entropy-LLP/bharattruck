// vehicle-schedule — D-19's read side: is this truck busy, and UNTIL WHEN.
//
// SCOPE NOTE — READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A DATE-WINDOW OVERLAP CHECK HERE.
// D-19 says "the truck carries the schedule; accepting work locks it for the
// window", and the obvious reading is a calendar: refuse a second load whose dates
// overlap, allow one whose dates do not. This module deliberately does NOT do that,
// because the schema makes the state such a check would guard against unreachable,
// and shipping the check anyway would mean shipping a guard whose refusals are all
// already made underneath it, plus prose describing a system we do not have:
//
//   - vehicle_assignments_one_live_per_vehicle (0016) is a partial unique index on
//     (vehicle_id) where released_at is null. It refuses ANY second live assignment
//     on a truck, overlapping or not. An overlap rule in front of it can only ever
//     refuse a SUBSET of what it already refuses — it can never turn an allow into
//     a refusal, which is the only way it could prevent a double-booking.
//   - vehicles_exactly_one_owner (0015) and vehicles_single_owner (0022) both assert
//     num_nonnulls(driver_id, fleet_owner_id) = 1. A truck has exactly ONE owner, so
//     "fleet A and fleet B commit the same truck" is not a hole, it is
//     unrepresentable — and requireFleetVehicle scopes every assignment to the
//     owning fleet regardless.
//   - by that same constraint a fleet-owned truck has driver_id NULL, so it has no
//     "own driver" to self-select marketplace work with; a driver-owned truck has
//     fleet_owner_id NULL, so no fleet can assign it.
//   - fleet_drivers_one_live_per_driver (0015) still permits a driver only ONE live
//     affiliation, so D-8's multi-fleet driver does not exist in the schema yet
//     either.
//
// What is genuinely unanswerable today is "the truck is busy — until when?". The
// index is a bit: on trip or idle, with no horizon. That is what this module adds,
// so an owner can plan the next load, plus a refusal that names the trip the truck
// is on instead of "already has a live assignment". When D-8 actually lands in the
// schema, the overlap check becomes worth writing — with the 0016 index relaxed in
// the same migration, since it is what makes the check dead today.
//
// THE ONE RULE: is_free here means exactly what the 0016 index means — no live
// commitment, for any dates. Answering from date windows instead would report a
// truck free for the 20th while it is out on the 10th, and then watch the
// assignment call for the 20th fail on the index every single time. An availability
// API that can disagree with the assignment API is worse than no availability API.

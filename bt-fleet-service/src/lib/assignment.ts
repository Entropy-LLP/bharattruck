// machine, which is why assignment writes bookings.driver_id/vehicle_id and then
// gets out of the way.
//
// CONCURRENCY: the three partial-unique indexes from migration 0016
// (one live assignment per booking, per vehicle, per driver) are the guard. We
// INSERT and catch 23505 rather than pre-checking — a check-then-insert has a race
// window in which two dispatchers can both hand the same truck to two loads.
//
// The D-19 commitment check sits IN FRONT of that insert and does not weaken it.
// It is not a second mutual-exclusion rule and must never be mistaken for one: a
// read-then-write check cannot win a race, and it refuses on exactly the condition
// the vehicle index already refuses on. It runs to turn "already has a live
// assignment" into a refusal that names the trip, and to catch the one commitment
// no index sees — a booking still running whose assignment row is gone.

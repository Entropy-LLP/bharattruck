// auctions — the READ side of fleet bidding.
//
// WHY THESE LIVE HERE AND NOT IN bt-booking-service: both are fleet-tenant-scoped
// list queries, which is exactly what this service owns (`/fleet/bookings`,
// `/fleet/live`, `/fleet/analytics/*` are all the same shape). The WRITE side —
// placing, countering and withdrawing a bid — deliberately stays in
// bt-booking-service on the existing `/bookings/:id/quotes*` routes, which already
// accept a fleet owner as a bidder, already enforce the auction-deadline and
// duplicate-bid rules, and are already exercised by the driver flow. Re-implementing
// or proxying those writes here would fork the auction rules across two services.
//
// COST/SHAPE: each function is ONE round trip plus a bounded hydrate. The auction
// board is polled by an open console, so a per-row fan-out would be a self-inflicted
// load problem at exactly the moment a dispatcher is watching many auctions at once.

 * Open loads this fleet may bid on, each annotated with its own existing bid.

 * (`target_driver_id`): `submitQuote` rejects those for a fleet with a 403, so
 * showing them would be a board of buttons that cannot work.
 *
 * By the SAME rule it excludes loads the caller POSTED (`excludeShipperUserId`).
 * submitQuote now refuses a self-bid, so leaving them on the board would again be
 * buttons that cannot work — but the exclusion is not merely cosmetic tidying. A
 * distributor's own load appearing under "Open loads" is an invitation to bid on it,
 * and until that refusal existed the invitation was accepted: one such bid was placed,
 * won, and recorded as a genuine auction in production. bt-booking-service's own feed
 * board has always applied this filter (feed/repository.ts listOpenWork); this query
 * was simply never taught it. The two boards now answer the same question the same way.
 *
 * NOTE the id types differ and are not interchangeable: the tenant is a
 * `fleet_owners.id`, while `bookings.shipper_id` is a `users.id`. Both are needed —
 * one scopes `my_bid`, the other the exclusion.
 *
 * `bid_count` is the ONLY thing exposed about rival bids — never their amounts or
 * identities. A dispatcher learning that a load has eight bids is normal auction
 * information; learning what the other eight fleets offered is not, and would turn
 * the marketplace into a race to the bottom.
